# Ingredient Diversity by Meal Category (TheMealDB API)

This project looks at how ingredients vary across different types of meals like beef, chicken, dessert, vegan, and seafood using data from TheMealDB API.

## What I wanted to find out

* Which ingredients show up most often in each category
* How ingredient variety compares between different meal types
* Differences between vegetarian/vegan dishes and meat-based ones

## Tools I used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Requests (to get the data from the API)
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for charts

## About the data

All the meal data comes from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

## What I did

* Pulled meal data from the API by category
* Cleaned and organized the ingredient information
* Counted how often ingredients appeared and compared categories
* Made charts to visualize what I found

## What I noticed

* Beef dishes shared more common ingredients compared to vegan meals
* Seafood and chicken dishes had a lot of overlap
* Desserts generally had fewer unique ingredients
